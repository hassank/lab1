                	Hey - welcome to my portfolio! I created this portfolio to add a personal side to my online 
                    presence while also challenging myself to learn enough HTML and CSS to build my own website from scratch.

                    <p> 
                        I am a Stanford undergrad, computer scientist, businessman, avid learner, caring friend, martial artist and much more.  
                        <br/>But, at my core, I am a farm boy of Honduran and Lebanese descent. 
                    </p> 
                    <br/> 
                    <p> 
                        I was lovingly raised on my family's farm in Vacaville, CA. Life on our farm  
                        instilled me with many lessons and a great education which led me to Stanford University,  
                        also fittingly known as 'The Farm' to many students. 
                    </p> 
                    <br/> 
                    <p> 
                        Life on my home farm gave me a great love for nature and good food, but it was 
                        the Stanford Farm which would introduce me to my greatest passion: educational 
                        technology. I hope to one day use computer science as a vehicle to improve America's 
                        education system.

                        Growing up around words like those from my father above, it's no wonder I value my education 
                        and constantly seek to learn more. At Stanford, I have studied chemistry, political science, 
                        and everything in between. I ultimately decided to major in computer science.

                        My decision to study computer science was driven by my love for creating products people can use. At the same time, 
                        I am interested in business management. I plan to obtain a Stanford Master's degree in Management Science 
                        after my undergraduate years.

                    <p> 
                        I am a computer scientist because I love to create products. When I was a kid, I played with LEGO blocks. Today, 
                        all I need is a compiler, unsweetened iced tea, and a few pieces of watermelon. 
                    </p> 
                    <br/> <br/> 
                    <p> 
                        When programming, I prefer to work in teams on products that stretch my creative muscle in both problem-solving 
                        and product design. Most of all, I enjoy making products that I know people could use. 
                    </p>

                        My favorite project was a quiz site I created for a class (CS108). The site is no longer live, but I enjoyed leading 
                        my team to produce over 8,000 lines of compatible code in little more than one week.

                        My family has operated in businesses ranging from floral design to all-natural farm meats. I played  
                        a crucial role in each endeavor - especially the formation of our meat business, Nature's Bounty.

                    <p> 
                        At the turn of America's recession, I helped my father to launch Nature's Bounty. Following 
                        the business's foundation, I directed advertising to develop a market presence for our business.  
                        Today, I continue to lead our outreach via online and community advertisements.

                        Within school, I sharpen my business skills by participating in the Stanford BASES Organization.
                        I am an Officer of Marketing for the BASES Product Showcase event.
